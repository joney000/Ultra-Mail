Hi Sagar ,
		   It was very nice experience to work on this Parallel Email Sender Project.
        previously I have written some mail API but they are sequential.So I found a efficient way now and I have coded it.
		
		Detail Solution to Problem : [Key Features]
		
		1.) Parallel Execution by taking advantage of Multi threaded Environment.
		2.) Synchronization and Bandwidth Utilization.
		3.) Scalability and Asynchronous mail Delivery.
		4.) Dynamic Load Management.
		5.) Prevents Duplicate mail sending.
		
	    My Project Structure :
		
		Ultra Mail[project_name]

			   |		|--Source Code

		I have Written Proper Documentation for Deployment of Project.Here is Location of Useful Info :
			1.)Read-ME.text  	 :==> Deployment Procedure, General Information,Concepts used. 
			2.)Testing.text  	 :==> Testing Details.
			3.)CREATE-INSERT.sql :==> sql query to create Email-queue table and insert data.
			
	In Addition ,In Each Class I mention the Particular Use of that class .
	
	Sir , Project is Working Fine on my Windows System .I have tested it with 400 mails.Mails are going with fine speed.I have tried to maintain Readability as much possible.I'm Submitting The final source code and Related Documentation.
		  If there is a Issue in Deployment or the functionality,I am happy to Know about it and will try to resolve it.
